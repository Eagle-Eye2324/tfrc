# VEX Code
The repository for all of the Terry Fox Robotic Club's VEX code.

## Editing Files
All of the files found in this repo are text files, whch means that all you need to edit them is a text editor.  However, there are a few editors that are much better to use for editing this stuff than others.  For files within a folder named "ROBOTC", the best editor to use is RobotC 4.x for VEX Robotics.  If you have an account with VEX, you can download it for free [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/robotc-vexedr-vexiq.html).  For files in a folder labled PROS, load the whole folder in the PROS editor, which you can find [here](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/).  And finally for files in a folder labeled VCS, use VEX Coding Studio, which you can get [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/products/programming).
