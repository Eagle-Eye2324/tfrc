# VEX Code
The repository for all of the Terry Fox Robotic Club's VEX code.

## Editing Files
All of the files found in this repo, wit the exceptino of the VCS files, are text files, whch means that all you need to edit them is a text editor.  However, there are a few editors that are much better to use for editing this stuff than others.  For files within the RobotC folder, the best editor to use is RobotC 4.x for VEX Robotics.  If you have an account with VEX, you can download it for free [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/robotc-vexedr-vexiq.html).  For files in the PROS folder, load the project folder in the PROS editor, which you can find [here](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/).  And finally for files in the VCS folder, use VEX Coding Studio, which you can get [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/products/programming).
