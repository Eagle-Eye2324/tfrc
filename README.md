# VEX Code
The repository for all of the Terry Fox Robotic Club's VEX code.

## Editing Files
All of the files found in this repo, with the exception of the VCS files, are text files, whch means that all you need to edit them is a text editor.  However, it is recommended to use an ide, and there are a few that are best to use, as they are designed specifically for it.  For files within the RobotC folder, the recommended IDE is RobotC 4.x for VEX Robotics.  If you have an account with VEX, you can download it for free [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/robotc-vexedr-vexiq.html).  For files in the PROS folder, the recommeded IDE is PROS, which you can find [here](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/).  For files in the VCS folder, you must use VEX Coding Studio, which is unfortunately no longer available.  And finally, for the files in the VEXcode V5 text folder, the recommended IDE is VEXcode V5 Text, which you can get for free [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download).  If you are wanting to upload the code to a VEX robot, you must use the recommended IDE.

## File organzation
The files within this repo are sorted in a specific way.  First, they are sorted by the IDE used, then by the competition year they were written for.
